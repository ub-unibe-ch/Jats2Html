            those who
            do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely

         <p>To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise,
            except
            to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who
            chooses
            to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that
            produces no resultant pleasure? On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation
            and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the
            moment,
            so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound
            to ensue;
            and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will,
            which is
