            No one
            rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because
            those who
            do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely
            painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain
            of itself,
            because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and
            pain can
            procure him some great pleasure.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn1" id="rfn1">1</a></sup></p>
         
         
         <p>To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise,
            except
            to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who
            chooses
            to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that
            produces no resultant pleasure? On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation
            and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the
            moment,
            so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound
            to ensue;
            and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will,
            which is
            the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain.</p>

            painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain
            of itself,
            because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and
            pain can

            to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that
            produces no resultant pleasure? On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation
            and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the

            so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound
            to ensue;
